# MyJavaExtractor
it was gon' be a real painstaking task to get all the links in the html file to click on since they were embedded in a div. So I solved the practical problem by reading the html file and extracting each link and write it in a new html file(Extracted) which made my work alot more easier

# navigate to the cloned directory

## Do the following on your terminal:

### javac Extractor.java

### java Extractor

That's it view Extracted content in Extracted.html
feel free to edit source code :)
